12,MISC,"This question has attracted much attention
"
13,MISC,"In many cases, an important quality measure is the  total  or cumulative  expected loss  of a predictor
"
14,MISC,"In particular the square loss is often considered
"
15,MISC,"Assume that the outcome space is finite, and the model class is continuously parameterized
"
16,MISC,"Then for Bayes mixture prediction, the cumulative expected square loss is usually small but unbounded, growing with  SYMBOL , where  SYMBOL  is the sample size  CITATION

18,MISC,"For the MDL predictor, the losses behave similarly  CITATION  under appropriate conditions, in particular with a specific prior

19,MISC,"Note that in order to do MDL for continuous model classes, one needs to  discretize  the parameter space, see also  CITATION
"
20,MISC,"On the other hand, if the model class is discrete, then Solomonoff's theorem  CITATION  bounds the cumulative expected square loss for the Bayes mixture predictions finitely, namely by  SYMBOL , where  SYMBOL  is the prior weight of the ``true"" model  SYMBOL
"
21,MISC,"The only necessary assumption is that the true distribution  SYMBOL  is contained in the model class, ie that we are dealing with  proper learning

22,MISC,"It has been demonstrated  CITATION , that for both Bayes mixture and MDL, the proper learning assumption can be essential: If it is violated, then learning may fail very badly
"
23,MISC,"For MDL predictions in the proper learning case, it has been shown  CITATION  that a bound of  SYMBOL  holds
"
24,MISC,"This bound is exponentially larger than the Solomonoff bound, and it is sharp in general

25,MISC,"A finite bound on the total expected square loss is particularly interesting:   It implies convergence of the predictive to the true probabilities with probability one

26,MISC,"In contrast, an instantaneous loss bound of  SYMBOL  implies only convergence in probability

27,MISC,"Additionally, it gives a  convergence speed , in the sense that errors of a certain magnitude cannot occur too often

28,MISC,"So for both, Bayes mixtures and MDL, convergence with probability one holds, while the convergence speed is exponentially worse for MDL compared to the Bayes mixture
"
29,MISC,"We avoid the term ``convergence rate"" here, since the order of convergence is identical in both cases

30,MISC,"It is eg  SYMBOL  if we additionally assume that the error is monotonically decreasing, which is not necessarily true in general)

"
205,OWNX,"we release to the community the as level topology dataset augmented with   NUMBER   the as taxonomy information and  NUMBER   the set of as attributes we used to classify ases
"
206,OWNX,"we believe that this dataset will serve as an invaluable addition to further understanding of the structure and evolution of the internet
"
207,MISC,"the rapid expansion of the internet in the last two decades has produced a large scale system of thousands of diverse  independently managed networks that collectively provide global connectivity across a wide spectrum of geopolitical environments
"
208,MISC,"from  NUMBER  to  NUMBER  the number of globally routable as identifiers has increased from less than  NUMBER   NUMBER  to more than  NUMBER   NUMBER   exerting significant pressure on interdomain routing as well as other functional and structural parts of the internet
"
209,MISC,"this impressive growth has resulted in a heterogenous and highly complex system that challenges accurate and realistic modeling of the internet infrastructure
"
210,MISC,"in particular  the as level topology is an intermix of networks owned and operated by many different organizations  e g   backbone providers  regional providers  access providers  universities and private companies
"
211,MISC,"statistical information that faithfully characterizes different as types is on the critical path toward understanding the structure of the internet  as well as for modeling its topology and growth
"
212,MISC,"in topology modeling  knowledge of as types is mandatory for augmenting synthetically constructed or measured as topologies with realistic intra as and inter as router level topologies
"
213,MISC,"for example  we expect the network of a dual homed university to be drastically different from that of a dual homed small company
"
214,MISC,"the university will likely contain dozens of internal routers  thousands of hosts  and many other network elements  switches  servers  firewalls 
"
215,MISC,"on the other hand  the small company will most probably have a single router and a simple network topology
"
216,MISC,"since there is such a diversity among different network types  we cannot accurately augment the as level topology with appropriate router level topologies if we cannot MISC	characterize the composing ases
"
217,MISC,"moreover  annotating the ases in the as topology with their types is a prerequisite for modeling the evolution of the internet  since different types of ases exhibit different growth patterns
"
218,MISC,"for example  internet service providers  isp  grow by attracting new customers and by engaging in business agreements with other isps
"
219,MISC,"on the other hand  small companies that connect to the internet through one or few isps do not grow significantly over time
"
220,MISC,"thus  categorizing different types of ases in the internet is necessary to identify network evolution patterns and develop accurate evolution models
"
221,MISC,"an as taxonomy is also necessary for mapping ip addresses to different types of users
"
222,MISC,"for example  in traffic analysis studies its often required to distinguish between packets that come from home and business users
"
223,MISC,"given an as taxonomy  its possible to realize this goal by checking the type of as that originates the prefix in which an ip address lies
"
224,AIMX,"in this work  we introduce a radically new approach based on machine learning to construct a representative as taxonomy
"
225,OWNX,"we develop an algorithm to classify ases based on empirically observed differences between as characteristics
"
226,OWNX,"we use a large set of data from the internet routing registries  irr   CITATION  and from routeviews  CITATION  to identify intrinsic differences between ases of different types
"
227,AIMX,"then  we employ a novel machine learning technique to build a classification algorithm that exploits these differences to classify ases into six representative classes that reflect ases with different network properties and infrastructures
"
228,OWNX,"we derive macroscopic statistics on the different types of ases in the internet and validate our results using a sample of  NUMBER  manually identified as types
"
229,OWNX,"our validation demonstrates that our classification algorithm achieves high accuracy   NUMBER   NUMBER  percent  of the examined classifications were correct
"
230,OWNX,"finally  we make our results and our classifier publicly available to promote further research and understanding of the internet s structure and evolution

231,OWNX,"in section  we start with a brief discussion of related work

1060,OWNX,"the exploration task was followed by a visual discrimination task  and the responses were analyzed using signal detection theory

1061,OWNX,"during exploration women selected a local searching strategy in which the metric distance between what is already known and what is unknown was reduced  whereas men adopted a global strategy based on an approximately uniform distribution of choices

1064,MISC,"males and females seem to differ in spatial abilities and styles  CITATION

1065,MISC,"generally  studies involving navigational problems showed that female cognitive style relies more on detailed information  while male style relies more on global information  CITATION
"
1066,MISC,"evolutionary mechanisms could potentially account for sex differences in spatial behavior
"
1067,MISC,"for example  these behavioral differences may be due to mating patterns that induced a selection of large-range navigation in males  CITATION

1068,MISC,"mating patterns or mating strategies are linked to the dynamics of reproduction and sexual selection  CITATION   and sexual selection is restricted to characteristics that influence mate choice and competition for mates

1071,MISC,"however  as argued by ecuyer-dab and robert  CITATION    the selection of male characteristics depends on females' choice for mates
"
1072,MISC,"in females  however  spatial cognition would have been primarily shaped by the natural selection of a strong concern for survival both of self and of offspring
"
1073,MISC,"this concern would have compelled them to favor low-risk strategies  like concentrating on proximal spatial cues  when coping with space-related problems
"
1074,MISC,"such focusing would have enabled secure navigation based on detailed landmark encoding  as well as  in certain species  regular feeding based on remembering the exact locations of potential resources  p  NUMBER 
"
1075,MISC,"thus  the hypothesis of labor division would be a by-product of sexual selection and not the cause of sex differences in spatial behavior
"
1076,MISC,"taken together  the literature seems to indicate that the key to understanding the evolution of behavioral sex differences relies on the relative costs and benefits of producing offspring  CITATION
"
1077,MISC,"in that context spatial skills play a crucial role since they increase reproductive success and the accessibility to food resource but  at the same time  multiply the risks of getting lost  being killed or consumed by other animals predation
"
1078,MISC,"hence  the survival of mobile species depends on their ability to balance costs and benefits induced by locomotion and this balancing should differ according to sex
"
1079,MISC,"experimental investigations of sex differences in spatial abilities yield apparently disparate results  CITATION

"
1280,MISC,"determinants of conflict identification in the face of temptation have been explored only recently
"
1281,MISC,"in some contexts, the question is almost trivial and identification of conflict virtually obvious
"
1282,MISC,"for example, the diabetic dieter probably knows that having even a single, tempting chocolate may incur major costs

"
1285,MISC,"similarly, the good citizen may find that a general failure to act generously would represent a major threat to his self-image, but being stingy on just a couple of occasions is a more ambiguous matter
"
1286,MISC,"myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  use the term epsilon cost temptation to denote tempting opportunities that incur nothing but trivial costs when consumed in small amounts, but potentially serious costs when consumed extensively
"
1287,MISC,"they argue that individuals identify self-control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation if and only if two conditions are met: a the focal consumption opportunity must be viewed in relation to multiple additional opportunities, and b the decision maker must assume that similar choices are made for each opportunity  CITATION
"
1288,MISC,"that is, considering the question of whether or not to have a delicious creamy cake will evoke self-control conflict in the dieter if the dining opportunity is viewed in relation to future opportunities for dessert consumption, but not if the dining opportunity is viewed in isolation, as a singular episode
"
1289,MISC,"similarly, the question of whether or not to be generous-to donate to a charitable organization-may elicit self-control conflict if the decision is viewed in relation to future decisions, but not if the decision is viewed in isolation
"
1290,MISC,"if viewed in relation to future decisions, the question of how much to donate on a single occasion may have bearing on the decision maker's self-image; donating now-and in the future-indicates a generous character, whereas keeping the money for oneself does not
"
1291,MISC,"however, if viewed in isolation, the question of how much to donate has little bearing on self-image; the present decision of how much to donate is considered only in light of immediate consequences, leaving self-image out of the equation
"
1292,MISC,"because a consistent self-image represents an important motivator for pro-social behavior  CITATION , we expect that individuals are more likely to identify self-control conflict between selfish and pro-social behavior if the allocation decision is seen in relation to future opportunities than if it is seen in isolation
"
1293,MISC,"myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  show that subtle framing manipulations are sufficient to influence identification of self-control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation
"
1294,MISC,"they find that presenting a calendar displaying the current month, with a grid separating the dates, raised participants' subsequent consumption of potato chips relative to that of participants whom were presented a calendar without a grid
"
1295,MISC,"they argue that the gridded calendar activated an isolated versus interrelated frame of the choice opportunity; it made participants more likely to isolate the date in question and thus less likely to see the decision task in relation to similar future opportunities
"
1296,MISC,"consequently, the grid reduced the likelihood that participants would identify a conflict between the temptation to have chips and the better judgment to maintain a fine figure and good health
"
1297,MISC,"indeed, participants who viewed the gridded calendar reported experiencing less conflict during their decision to have chips or not than did those who viewed the non-gridded calendar
"
1298,MISC,"furthermore, participants' trait ability to implement self-control strategies, measured by rosenbaum's  CITATION  psychometric scale, was positively associated with chips consumption for those who viewed the calendar without the grid and who were more likely to identify conflict, but not for others who viewed the calendar with and who were less likely to identify conflict
"
1299,MISC,"that is, participants who viewed the calendar without the grid, more likely than those who viewed the calendar with, identified self-control conflict and therefore leveraged their self-control strategies to resist the tempting chips
"
1300,OWNX,"to explore our hypothesis that the problem of pro-social versus selfish behavior may represent one of self-control, we have applied the empirical strategy from myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  in the dictator game-a participant is granted an endowment and asked to split it between herself and a recipient  CITATION , and in our case the red cross featured as recipient  CITATION

1306,OWNX,"this means that for a given level of self-control, one might observe substantially different donation behavior depending on whether conflict was identified or not"

1308,OWNX," we manipulated the likelihood that individuals would identify self-control conflict, and we measured their trait ability to implement self-control strategies

1309,OWNX," our analysis reveals a positive and significant correlation between trait self-control and pro-social behavior in the treatment where we expected a relatively high likelihood of conflict identification-but not in the treatment where we expected a low likelihood

1424,MISC,"closest to our domain of inquiry, piovesan and wengstrom  CITATION  measured response times of participants in a repeated dictator game, lasting 24 periods
"
1425,MISC,"they find both across and within participants that lower response times are associated with more selfish choices
"
1426,MISC,"one interpretation of their results is that the default behavior is to act selfishly and that pro-social behavior requires the successful resolution of a self-control conflict, which slows the response time
"
1427,MISC,"such successful resolution of conflict would require cognitive resources, but hauge et al CITATION  report no effect of cognitive load on players in one-shot dictator games
"
1428,AIMX,"in this paper we attempt a more direct test of the hypothesis that pro-social versus selfish behavior may represent a self-control problem
"
1429,OWNX,"we employ a standard measure of pure pro-social behavior, the one-shot dictator game, which invokes neither concerns for strategy nor for reciprocity; and a well-grounded psychometric measure of self-control, the rosenbaum self-control schedule  CITATION
"
1430,OWNX,"further, we explore the conditions under which we expect an association between self-control and pro-social behavior
"
1431,BASE,"in so doing, we rely on two conditions necessary for successfully exercising restraint in the face of temptation; myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  propose a two-stage model of self-control, which postulates that an individual in the face of temptation first identifies conflict or not between indulging and pursuing a higher-order goal and, second, that the individual next employs self-control strategies if and only if conflict was identified at the first stage see figure 1
"
1432,MISC,"critically, self-control strategies are relevant to the decision to indulge only when the individual has identified self-control conflict
"
1433,MISC,"therefore, one strategy for investigating whether the problem of pro-social versus selfish behavior resembles one of self-control is to test whether the tendency to apply self-control strategies is positively associated with pro-social behavior when individuals have identified self-control conflict, but less so or not at all when individuals have not
"
1434,MISC,"determinants of conflict identification in the face of temptation have been explored only recently
"
1435,MISC,"in some contexts, the question is almost trivial and identification of conflict virtually obvious
"
1436,MISC,"for example, the diabetic dieter probably knows that having even a single, tempting chocolate may incur major costs
"
1437,MISC,"however, the question of self-control conflict is more ambiguous for the non-diabetic dieter, who faces the same chocolate
"
1438,MISC,"having this one chocolate alone will not incur major costs, but doing so regularly might
"
1439,MISC,"similarly, the good citizen may find that a general failure to act generously would represent a major threat to his self-image, but being stingy on just a couple of occasions is a more ambiguous matter
"
1440,MISC,"myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  use the term epsilon cost temptation to denote tempting opportunities that incur nothing but trivial costs when consumed in small amounts, but potentially serious costs when consumed extensively
"
1441,MISC,"they argue that individuals identify self-control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation if and only if two conditions are met: a the focal consumption opportunity must be viewed in relation to multiple additional opportunities, and b the decision maker must assume that similar choices are made for each opportunity  CITATION
"
1442,MISC,"that is, considering the question of whether or not to have a delicious creamy cake will evoke self-control conflict in the dieter if the dining opportunity is viewed in relation to future opportunities for dessert consumption, but not if the dining opportunity is viewed in isolation, as a singular episode
"
1443,MISC,"similarly, the question of whether or not to be generous-to donate to a charitable organization-may elicit self-control conflict if the decision is viewed in relation to future decisions, but not if the decision is viewed in isolation
"
1444,MISC,"if viewed in relation to future decisions, the question of how much to donate on a single occasion may have bearing on the decision maker's self-image; donating now-and in the future-indicates a generous character, whereas keeping the money for oneself does not
"
1445,MISC,"however, if viewed in isolation, the question of how much to donate has little bearing on self-image; the present decision of how much to donate is considered only in light of immediate consequences, leaving self-image out of the equation
"
1446,OWNX,"because a consistent self-image represents an important motivator for pro-social behavior  CITATION , we expect that individuals are more likely to identify self-control conflict between selfish and pro-social behavior if the allocation decision is seen in relation to future opportunities than if it is seen in isolation
"
1447,MISC,"myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  show that subtle framing manipulations are sufficient to influence identification of self-control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation
"
1448,MISC,"they find that presenting a calendar displaying the current month, with a grid separating the dates, raised participants' subsequent consumption of potato chips relative to that of participants whom were presented a calendar without a grid
"
1449,MISC,"they argue that the gridded calendar activated an isolated versus interrelated frame of the choice opportunity; it made participants more likely to isolate the date in question and thus less likely to see the decision task in relation to similar future opportunities
"
1450,MISC,"consequently, the grid reduced the likelihood that participants would identify a conflict between the temptation to have chips and the better judgment to maintain a fine figure and good health
"
1451,MISC,"indeed, participants who viewed the gridded calendar reported experiencing less conflict during their decision to have chips or not than did those who viewed the non-gridded calendar
"
1452,MISC,"furthermore, participants' trait ability to implement self-control strategies, measured by rosenbaum's  CITATION  psychometric scale, was positively associated with chips consumption for those who viewed the calendar without the grid and who were more likely to identify conflict, but not for others who viewed the calendar with and who were less likely to identify conflict
"
1453,MISC,"that is, participants who viewed the calendar without the grid, more likely than those who viewed the calendar with, identified self-control conflict and therefore leveraged their self-control strategies to resist the tempting chips
"
1454,BASE,"to explore our hypothesis that the problem of pro-social versus selfish behavior may represent one of self-control, we have applied the empirical strategy from myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  in the dictator game-a participant is granted an endowment and asked to split it between herself and a recipient  CITATION , and in our case the red cross featured as recipient  CITATION
"
1455,OWNX,"the game thus pits pro-social motivations against self-interest
"
1456,OWNX,"if pro-social versus selfish behavior could represent a self-control conflict, we would expect participants' trait self-control, as measured by rosenbaum's  CITATION  scale, to correlate positively with pro-social behavior for participants who have just previously viewed a calendar without a grid, but less so or not at all for participants who have viewed a calendar with
"
1457,OWNX,"the graph in figure 2 displays donation, as a function of level of self-control, for two different levels of identification likelihood
"
1458,OWNX,"in the case of low likelihood, the slope is expected to be weakly positive
"
1459,OWNX,"in the case of the higher likelihood, however, the slope is expected to be strictly greater than that in the case of low likelihood
"
1460,OWNX,"this means that for a given level of self-control, one might observe substantially different donation behavior depending on whether conflict was identified or not

1580,OWNX,"however, the choices are designed so that the tax model with parameters typical of previous research predicts that people will shift their choices in the opposite direction of ev, eu, cpt, and ph"
1581,MISC,"previous tests of cumulative prospect theory cpt and of the priority heuristic ph found evidence contradicting these two models of risky decision making
"
1582,MISC,"however, those tests were criticized because they had characteristics that might ""trigger"" use of other heuristics
"
1583,AIMX,"this paper presents new tests that avoid those characteristics
"
1584,OWNX,"expected values of the gambles are nearly equal in each choice
"
1585,OWNX,"in addition, if a person followed expected value ev, expected utility eu, cpt, or ph in these tests, she would shift her preferences in the same direction as shifts in ev or eu
"
1586,MISC,"in contrast, the transfer of attention exchange model tax and a similarity model predict that people will reverse preferences in the opposite direction
"
1587,CONT,"results contradict the ph, even when ph is modified to include a preliminary similarity evaluation using the ph parameters

"
1589,OWNX,"strong interactions were observed, contrary to ph
"
1590,OWNX,"these results add to the growing bodies of evidence showing that neither cpt nor ph is an accurate description of risky decision making
"
1591,AIMX,"this paper compares three models that attempt to describe risky decision making
"
1592,MISC,"these models are cumulative prospect theory cpt  CITATION , birnbaum's  CITATION  transfer of attention exchange model tax, and the priority heuristic ph of brandstatter, gigerenzer, and hertwig  CITATION
"
1593,MISC,"the ph model is based on the idea that people compare one attribute at a time, such as the minimum prizes
"
1594,MISC,"in addition, the similarity model of rubinstein  CITATION  as modified by leland  CITATION  is also relevant to these studies, although these studies were not designed to test that model
"
1595,MISC,"birnbaum  CITATION  reviewed a number of critical tests that refute any rank dependent utility rdu model  CITATION  including rank and sign-dependent utility  CITATION , cpt, and expected utility eu
"
1596,MISC,"birnbaum  CITATION  noted that many of the same tests that refute cpt also contradict the priority heuristic
"
1597,MISC,"for example, the priority heuristic predicted fewer than half of the modal choices analyzed by birnbaum  CITATION , by birnbaum  CITATION , and by birnbaum and navarrete  CITATION
"
1598,MISC,"some of these choices included cases where 90% or more of the participants satisfied stochastic dominance but the priority heuristic predicts indifference
"
1599,MISC,"in other choices, significantly more than half of the participants about 70% of undergraduates violated stochastic dominance, but the priority heuristic predicts that people should satisfy it
"
1600,MISC,"brandstatter, gigerenzer, and hertwig  CITATION  responded that properties of these choices may have induced people to use other heuristics drawn from a person's ""adaptive toolbox""
"
1601,MISC,"presumably, decision makers first decide what rule to use, then they either apply that rule or choose to use another rule
"
1602,MISC,"the mechanism that decides what rule to use has not yet been specified; it is described instead with lists of ""triggering conditions,"" which are estimated from data like parameters
"
1603,MISC,"brandstatter et al CITATION  concluded that the priority heuristic does not apply when there is a stochastic dominance relation in the choice
"
1604,MISC,"in addition, brandstatter et al CITATION  argued that certain choices reviewed by birnbaum  CITATION  used gambles that differed in expected value ev
"
1605,MISC,"brandstatter et al CITATION  presented a figure to show that the priority heuristic is not accurate when expected values evs differ, which led them to suppose that two strategies are at work, one for ""easy"" choices that differ in ev and one for ""harder"" choices where evs are nearly equal
"
1606,MISC,"from the data, brandstatter et al CITATION  estimated that, when the ratio of ev exceeds 2, people act as if they choose the gamble with the higher ev
"
1607,MISC,"brandstatter et al consider ev ratio as a proxy for the ""difficulty"" of a choice, but do not necessarily hold that people actually compute ratios of ev
"
1608,MISC,"they argued that the priority heuristic is accurate for ""difficult"" choices in which evs are nearly equal
"
1609,MISC,"however, birnbaum  CITATION  noted that ev ratios in birnbaum and navarrete  CITATION  had been inside the region where ph is supposed to apply; in that study, the priority heuristic failed to reproduce even half of the modal choices correctly
"
1610,MISC,"brandstatter et al CITATION  replicated part of that study and their results confirmed that the priority heuristic reproduced fewer than half of the modal choices that they chose for replication  CITATION
"
1611,MISC,"to account for the results, brandstatter et al noted that birnbaum and navarrete  CITATION  used many choices in which both gambles of a choice had the same probability distribution and in some choices two branches had the same probability
"
1612,MISC,"ph was not accurate for such choices, so brandstatter, et al CITATION  theorized that people use a ""toting up"" heuristic for choices in which two branches had the same probability
"
1613,MISC,"in some of the choices in birnbaum and navarrete  CITATION , there was a common probability-consequence branch in both choices, which was theorized to trigger editing rules and other heuristics that were called up to account for the failures of the priority heuristic
"
1614,MISC,"the arguments of brandstatter et al CITATION  might also provide excuses for previous failures of cpt as well
"
1615,AIMX,"this paper devises a new type of test that avoids the exceptions stated above
"
1616,OWNX,"in these tests, one alternative does not stochastically dominate the other, there are no common probability-consequence branches, probabilities of the consequences are not equal, and expected values are nearly equal

1629,MISC,"schwarz et al CITATION  observed that the classic studies demonstrating the availability heuristic failed to distinguish an interpretation based on ease of retrieval from an alternative interpretation based on content of retrieval in which an event is judged more common when a larger number of examples come to mind

2169,MISC,"This model is denoted by FORMULA which stands for, respectively, the Lennard-Jones native contact potentials, local backbone stiffness represented by harmonic terms that favor the native values of local chiralities, the contact map in which there are no FORMULA contacts, and the amplitude of the Lennard-Jones potential, FORMULA, is uniform.
"
2170,MISC,"The contact map is determined by assigning the van der Waals spheres to the heavy atoms and by checking whether spheres belonging to different amino acids overlap in the native state CITATION, CITATION.
"
2171,MISC,"If they do, a contact is declared as native.
"
2172,MISC,"Non-native contacts are considered repulsive.
"
2173,MISC,"Application of this criterion frequently selects the FORMULA contacts as native.
"
2174,MISC,"If the contact map includes these contacts the resulting model will be denoted here as FORMULA.
"
2175,MISC,"On average, it performs worse than FORMULA because the FORMULA contacts usually correspond to the weak van der Waals couplings as can be demonstrated in a sample of proteins by using a software CITATION which analyses atomic configurations from the chemical perspective on molecular bonds.
"
2176,MISC,"Thus the FORMULA couplings should better be removed from the contact map .
"
2177,MISC,"The survey to determine FORMULA in 7510 model proteins with the number of amino acids, FORMULA, not exceeding 150 and 239 longer proteins has been accomplished twice.
"
2178,MISC,"First within the FORMULA model CITATION and soon afterwords within the FORMULA model CITATION.
"
2179,MISC,"The first survey also comes with many details of the methodology whereas the second just presents the outcomes.
"
2180,MISC,"The two surveys are compared in more details in refs. CITATION, CITATION.
"
2181,MISC,"The results differ, particularly when it comes to ranking of the proteins according to the value of FORMULA, but they mutually provide the error bars on the findings.
"
2182,MISC,"They both agree, however, on predicting that there are many proteins whose strength should be considerably larger than the frequently studied benchmark the sarcomere protein titin.
"
2183,MISC,"Near the top of the list, there is the scaffoldin protein c7A which has been recently measured to have FORMULA of about 480 pN CITATION.
"
2184,MISC,"Other findings include establishing correlations with the CATH hierarchical classification scheme CITATION, CITATION, such as that there are no strong FORMULA proteins, and identification of several types of the force clamps.
"
2185,MISC,"The large forces most commonly originate in parallel FORMULA that are sheared CITATION.
"
2186,MISC,"However, there are also clamps with antiparallel FORMULA, unstructured strands, and other kinds.
"
2187,MISC,"The two surveys have been based on the structure download made on July 26, 2005 when the PDB comprised 29 385 entries.
"
2188,MISC,"Many of them correspond to nucleic acids, complexes with nucleic acids and with other proteins, carbohydrates, or come with incomplete files and hence the much smaller number of proteins that could be used in the molecular dynamics studies.
"
2189,AIMX,"Here, we present results of still another survey which is based on a download of December 18, 2008 which contains 54 807 structure files and leads to 17 134 acceptable structures with FORMULA not exceeding 250.
"
2190,OWNX,"These structures are then analyzed through simulations based on the FORMULA model.
"
2191,OWNX,"The numerical code has been improved to allow for acceleration of calculations by a factor of 2.
"
2192,OWNX,"The 190 structures with the top values of FORMULA in units of FORMULA are shown in Table 1 and Table S1 of the SI, together with the values of titin and ubiquitin to provide a scale.
"
2193,OWNX,"As argued in the Materials and Methods section section, the unit of force, FORMULA, is now estimated to be of order 110 pN.
"
2194,OWNX,"All of the corresponding proteins are predicted to be much stronger than titin and none but two of them have been studied experimentally yet.
"
2195,OWNX,"In addition to the types of force clamps identified before, we have discovered two new mechanisms of sturdiness.
"
2196,OWNX,"One of them involves a cysteine slipknot and is found to be operational in all of the 13 top strength proteins.
"
2197,OWNX,"In this motif, a slip-loop is pulled out of a cysteine knot-loop.
"
2198,OWNX,"Another involves dragging of a single fragment of the main chain across a cysteine knot-loop.
"
2199,OWNX,"The two mechanisms are similar in spirit since both involve dragging of the backbone.
"
2200,OWNX,"However, in the CSK case, two fragments of the backbone are participating.
"
2201,OWNX,"We make a more systematic identification of the CATH-classified architectures that are linked to mechanical strength and then analyze correlations of the data to the SCOP-based grouping CITATION CITATION.
"
2202,CONT,"The previous surveys did not relate to the SCOP scheme.
"
2203,OWNX,"We identify the CATH-based architectures and SCOP-based folds that are associated with the occurrence of a strong resistance to pulling.
"
2204,OWNX,"A general observation, however, is that each such group of structures may also include examples of proteins that unravel easily.
"
2205,OWNX,"The dynamics of a protein are very sensitive to mechanical details that are largely captured by the contact map and not just by the appearance of a structure.
"
2206,OWNX,"On the other hand, if one were to look for mechanically strong proteins then the architectures and folds identified by us should provide a good starting point.
"
2207,OWNX,"We also study the dependence of FORMULA on the pulling velocity and characterize the dependence on FORMULA through distributions of the forces.
"
2208,MISC,"The current third survey has been performed within the same FORMULA model as the second survey CITATION.
"
2209,BASE,"However, we reuse and extend it here because the editors of Biophysical Journal retracted the second survey CITATION.

2210,OWNX,"All of the values of FORMULA are deposited at the website LINK and can by accessed by through the PDB structure code.

2515,MISC,"Furthermore, although a clear enhancement of horizontal amplitudes could be observed in the spectra, horizontal amplitudes showed a somewhat noisy dependence on spatial frequency.
"
2516,MISC,"Both effects are a consequence of that face features were not considered individually, what causes a mixing of the spatial frequency content of individual face features in the spectra.
"
2517,MISC,"The mixing leads to averaging-out effects such that any possible enhancement of spectral amplitudes at other than the horizontal orientation goes unnoticed, but also may cause interference effects which lead to the mentioned noisy dependence of amplitudes on spatial frequency.

2525,OWNX,"The present study therefore shows how the individual internal face features contribute to the psychophysically observed frequency preference, and proposes concrete mechanisms of how higher amplitudes of whitened cell responses at an early level could possibly lead to the psychophysically measured effects."
2526,MISC,"Numerous psychophysical experiments found that humans preferably rely on a narrow band of spatial frequencies for recognition of face identity.
"
2527,MISC,"A recently conducted theoretical study by the author suggests that this frequency preference reflects an adaptation of the brain's face processing machinery to this specific stimulus class.
"
2528,AIMX,"The purpose of the present study is to examine this property in greater detail and to specifically elucidate the implication of internal face features.
"
2529,OWNX,"To this end, I parameterized Gabor filters to match the spatial receptive field of contrast sensitive neurons in the primary visual cortex.
"
2530,OWNX,"Filter responses to a large number of face images were computed, aligned for internal face features, and response-equalized.
"
2531,OWNX,"The results demonstrate that the frequency preference is caused by internal face features.

"
2536,MISC,"As for visual stimuli, natural images reveal a conspicuous statistical regularity that comes as an approximately linear decrease of their amplitude spectra as a function of spatial frequency CITATION CITATION.
"
2537,MISC,"This means that pairs of luminance values are strongly correlated CITATION, and this property could be exploited for gain controlling of visual neurons.
"
2538,MISC,"Then, visual neurons would have equal sensitivities or response amplitudes independent of their spatial frequency preference CITATION.
"
2539,MISC,"According to this response equalization hypothesis, gain should thus be incremented with increasing spatial frequency, such that the distribution of response amplitudes of frequency-tuned neurons to a typical natural image is flat.

2867,CONT,"However, as ion channels have multiple functional states with transitions that often depend on the membrane voltage CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, this may not accurately account for the noise introduced by ion channel currents.

2868,MISC,"A more accurate alternative is to explicitly model transitions between different functional states for each ion channel on a neuron's membrane.
"
2869,CONT,"However, for neurons with complex axonal or dendritic architectures there are two substantial obstacles to this approach.

2870,CONT,"First, typical central neurons express large numbers of ion channels and simulations must be repeated many times to obtain statistically valid descriptions CITATION.
"
2871,CONT,"This is a formidable computational task and even relatively straightforward simulations of the consequences of stochastic channel gating can require substantial computing time.
"
2872,CONT,"Second, each neuronal ion channel occupies a specific location on the extra-cellular membrane, whereas most neuronal models represent the distribution of ion channels as the density of a deterministic conductance across an area of membrane.
"
2873,CONT,"Although this formalism has been successful for simulating many aspects of neuronal activity, it is of less use for models that explore the consequences of the localization of individual ion channels, for example to evaluate the macroscopic effects of short range interactions between ion channels and other signaling molecules CITATION, or the consequences of spatially heterogeneous distributions of ion channels within relatively small sub-cellular structures such as dendritic spines and axon terminals CITATION, CITATION .
"
2874,AIMX,"To address the functional consequences of stochastic ion channel gating in neurons with extensive dendritic or axonal arborizations we developed a parallel stochastic ion channel simulator, which enables efficient simulation of the electrical activity of neurons with complex morphologies and arbitrary localization of stochastic ion channels on the extracellular membrane, while also addressing limitations of previous approaches.

2877,OWNX,"We then identify previously unappreciated differences between the effects of stochastic ion channel gating on somatic and dendritic membrane potential activity in several different morphological classes of neuron.

2879,BASE,"Using a previously well-validated realistic model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron we demonstrate that stochastic ion channel gating influences spike output in response to dendritic synaptic input.
"
2880,OWNX,"We show that stochastic gating of axonal or dendritic ion channels substantially modifies synaptically driven dendritic and axonal spike output, with stochastic gating of voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels having the greatest impact and hyperpolarization-activated channels the least.

3034,MISC,"The importance of electrostatics for co-receptor tropism has been recognized early on, and the best-known model, the so-called 11/25-rule, refers to charges of V3-residues 11 and 25: if one of these is positive, then the virus is CXCR4-tropic CITATION, CITATION.

"
3043,OWNX,"By the latter we consider a seemingly trivial but fundamental fact that so far has not been thoroughly exploited: although V3 is highly variable, all X4-tropic V3 loops share one property, namely, they preferentially have a physical binding interaction with CXCR4, while R5-tropic V3 loops preferably interacts with CCR5.
